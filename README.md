# covid_radiography_classifier

Wrote a classifierthat takes in chest X-ray images and determines whether it indicates Covid-19, a normal chest, or viral pneumonia using a convolutional neural network. Dataset from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database). Uses Fast.ai API for PyTorch to achieve a 2.5% errorrate.

Contains the python code that was used to export the covid classifier CNN. Neural network trained using fastai library.
